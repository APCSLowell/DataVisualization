# Getting Started With Data Visualizations
In this assignment you will create a picture that will help in understanding a list of data. (More details to come)

Suggested steps to complete this assignment
-------------------------------------------
1. For this assignment you are welcome to collaborate with a partner. You can both work on the same visualization, or you can share a data set and each create a differnet visualization.   

1. To start, you will need some data. You can use data you find on the Internet or create your own. You should then put your data into a list.

2. Once you've collected data, you can start coding. Some ideas for visualizations include:
   - Changing opacity so frequently occuring values are brighter 
   - Changing size so frequently occuring values are larger
   - Creating a bar graph
   - Creating a color grid
   - Create your own visualization
