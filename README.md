Suggested steps to complete this assignment
-------------------------------------------
1. First you need some data You can use the data set provided or find or create your own. You can collaborate with a partner. You both can work on the same visualization, or you can share a data set and each create a differnet visualization.

2. Once you've collected data, you can start coding. Some ideas for visualizations include:
  - Chainging opacity so frequently occuring values are brighter 
  - Chainging size so frequently occuring values are larger
  - Creating a bar graph
  - Creating a color grid
