# Getting Started With Data Visualizations
In this assignment you will create a picture that will help in understanding a list of data. You may find slides 144 - 171 of the PythonProcessing.pptx PowerPoint slides helpful in this assignment.

Suggested steps to complete this assignment
-------------------------------------------
1. For this assignment you are welcome to collaborate with a partner. You can both work on the same visualization, or you can share a data set and each create a different visualization.   

1. To start, you will need some data. You can use data you find on the Internet or create your own. You should then put your data into a list.

2. Once you've collected data, you can start coding. Some ideas for visualizations include:
   - Changing opacity so frequently occuring values are brighter 
   - Changing size so frequently occuring values are larger
   - Creating a bar graph
   - Creating a color grid
   - Using a [Chernoff face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face)
   - Visiting the [Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) for examples of other types of visualizations
   - Create your own visualization, your visualization doesn't have to look like any other. Have fun and be creative!
