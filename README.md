# Make a Data Visualization
In this assignment you will create a picture that will help in understanding an array of data. You may find [apjavaProcessing slide presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sqbareaFmF9fMcp0XOl3hRO6hAlrU5WIaj4V-Kd3eDI/edit?usp=sharing) helpful. Your program should use a variety of the [Processing graphics functions](https://processing.org/reference/). You will also define two functions:  
`void setup()`  
`void draw()`  
Scroll down to see screenshots of other students submissions for this assignment. Have fun and be creative! Your data visualization  doesn't have to look like anyone else's.

Suggested steps to complete this assignment
-------------------------------------------
1. For this assignment you are welcome to collaborate with a partner. You can both work on the same visualization, or you can share a data set and each create a different visualization.   

1. To start, you will need some data. You can use data you find on the Internet or create your own. You should then put your data into an array.

2. Once you've collected data, you can start coding. Some ideas for visualizations include:
   - Changing opacity so frequently occuring values are brighter 
   - Changing size so frequently occuring values are larger
   - Creating a bar graph
   - Creating an interactive map
   - Creating a color grid
   - Using a [Chernoff face](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face)
   - Visiting the [Data Visualisation Catalogue](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) for examples of other types of visualizations
   - Create your own visualization, your visualization doesn't have to look like any other. Have fun and be creative!
   


4. Save your work each day by choosing *File | Save*. The first time you save your program, you'll be prompted to give it a name.
Choose a meaningful name like `DataVisualization`.
5. When you come back the next day, one way to find your program is to choose *File | Open Recent*.  The code is stored in a folder in the `Processing` folder in your `My Documents` folder. 
6. When you are done, submit your code in Google classroom by browsing to your `DataVisualization.pde` file. The path should be `My Documents | Processing | DavaVisualization`. If you worked with a partnet, both you and your partner should submit the same code to Google Classroom.
7. For full credit you should also submit a screenshot. In Windows, one way to take a screenshot is with the `Snipping Tool`.
